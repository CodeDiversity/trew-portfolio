                <p>Hello, my name is Michael Trew. I am currently located in Northeast Ohio, looking for professional
                    work
                    as a web developer. I have a Bachelors in Management, a Masters Degree in Cyber Security, and most
                    recently I attended Lambda School for 15 months for my true passion, web development. You can view
                    their
                    curriculum with some of the things I've learned at Lambda School Curriculum. If you have any
                    questions
                    please reach out to me, I am open to relocation anywhere in the United States for the right
                    opportunity
                    as well as remote work.</p>
                <p>Some of my hobbies when I'm not coding include traveling and photography. I absolutely love landscape
                    photography, Ohio has a lot of beautiful places to explore and take great photos of, especially in
                    the
                    fall. I also enjoy working out and running (although I'm currently still considered a beginner at
                    running), I would like to run a couple 5k's in 2020.</p>

                <h3>Rate My Diy</h3>
                <p>Rate My DIY was a project that I was able to work on a team during Lambda School with. Myself and two
                    other developers collaborated as a team to work on this project. We used React JS and Apollo Client
                    on
                    the front-end and we used GraphQL, and Apollo Server and Prisma for our backend. The goal of this
                    app is
                    to be a website where users can create an account, and share their favorite DIY home projects, other
                    users can either up vote, or down vote the project and leave reviews.</p>

                <h3>Architectural Firm Website</h3>
                <p>This site was made for a fictitious architect firm during Lambda School for a project week. The site
                    uses best practices for responsive web design and the site was made per design specifications. The
                    project also uses responsive techniques to look good on multiple screen sizes but takes a desktop
                    first approach in this instance. The site was built with JavaScript, HTML, and LESS</p>
